You are an expert full-stack AI engineer building a HACKATHON-READY prototype.

GOAL:
Build a COMPLETE, DEMONSTRATABLE web-based Agentic AI Personal Loan Chatbot prototype for a BFSI NBFC (Tata Capital–like use case).

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
• This is a FREE-TIER Replit build – avoid paid services
• Must run fully inside Replit
• Use mock data only
• Focus on functionality, not heavy UI
• No re-architecture once built

TECH STACK (MANDATORY):
• Backend: Python + FastAPI
• Frontend: Simple HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no React)
• AI Logic: Rule-based + prompt-based agent simulation (NO external paid LLM APIs)
• PDF Generation: reportlab
• Storage: JSON files (no databases)
• File Upload: local filesystem

ARCHITECTURE (STRICT):
Implement AGENTIC AI using a MASTER AGENT and WORKER AGENTS.

AGENTS:
1. Master Agent (Orchestrator)
   - Handles entire conversation flow
   - Decides which Worker Agent to invoke
   - Maintains session state per user
   - Starts and ends chat

2. Worker Agents:
   a) Sales Agent
      - Collects loan amount, tenure
      - Persuades user with EMI estimate
   b) Verification Agent
      - Fetches KYC from mock CRM JSON
   c) Underwriting Agent
      - Fetches credit score from mock Credit Bureau JSON
      - Rules:
        • Credit score < 700 → Reject
        • Loan ≤ pre-approved limit → Approve
        • Loan ≤ 2× pre-approved limit → Ask salary slip
        • EMI ≤ 50% salary → Approve
        • Else → Reject
   d) Sanction Letter Generator
      - Generates PDF sanction letter if approved

DATA (CREATE THESE FILES):
• data/customers.json (10 dummy customers)
  Fields:
  name, age, city, phone, credit_score, preapproved_limit, salary

• data/offers.json (pre-approved offers)

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
• FastAPI app on port 3000
• POST /chat → main conversation endpoint
• POST /upload-salary → salary slip upload
• Session memory stored in Python dictionary
• Clear logs printed for each agent invocation

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
• Simple chat UI:
  - Input box
  - Send button
  - Chat history
• Salary slip upload button appears ONLY when required
• Download link appears when sanction PDF is generated

OUTPUTS (MANDATORY):
• Working chatbot
• Salary slip upload flow
• Credit decision logic visible in logs
• Downloadable PDF sanction letter
• Clean folder structure

IMPORTANT:
• Code must be COMPLETE and RUNNABLE
• Do NOT leave TODOs
• Do NOT use placeholders
• Explain briefly in comments where agents are invoked
• Optimize for demo clarity

FINAL CHECK:
When finished, print:
"Prototype ready: Agentic AI Personal Loan Chatbot running successfully"

Now build the entire project.
